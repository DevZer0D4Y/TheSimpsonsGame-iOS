 * @file        ring_progress.h
 * @brief       Waiting for the command processor to advance through the ring buffer.
 *
 * The game's Direct3D code waits for the GPU to consume its command ring
 * before reusing command memory, polling the read pointer the command
 * processor writes back to guest memory. On the Xbox 360 that poll paused the
 * hardware thread between checks; recompiled, it spins a host core flat out,
 * which on a power-limited APU takes power from the GPU. A hook can instead
 * block until the command processor next makes progress visible to the guest:
 * a read pointer writeback, or a scratch register writeback (the fence values
 * the Direct3D code waits on).
